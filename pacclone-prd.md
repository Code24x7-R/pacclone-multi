# PRD: Pac-Clone Game

1. Overview

Pac-Clone is a browser-based implementation of the classic Pac-Man arcade game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game recreates the core mechanics of Pac-Man including maze navigation, pellet collection, ghost avoidance, and power-ups.

2. Objectives
Create an engaging, browser-based Pac-Man experience
Implement core game mechanics from the original arcade game
Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes
Provide intuitive controls for both desktop and mobile devices
Deliver smooth performance with consistent frame rates

3. User Stories

* As a player, I want to navigate Pac-Man through a maze using intuitive controls
* As a player, I want to collect pellets to increase my score
* As a player, I want to avoid ghosts that are chasing me
* As a player, I want to collect power pellets to temporarily turn the tables on ghosts
* As a player, I want to see my current score and highest score
* As a player, I want the game to work on both desktop and mobile devices

5. Implementation Details
5.1. Game Architecture
The game follows a modular structure with these key components:
Game Controller: Manages game state, timing, and overall flow
Board Manager: Handles maze layout, collisions, and item collection
Character System: Controls Pac-Man and ghost behaviors/movement
UI Manager: Handles score, lives, and interface updates
Input Handler: Processes user input for different devices

5.2. Key Algorithms
5.2.1. Ghost AI
Implement different behavior modes (chase, scatter, frightened)
Pathfinding algorithms for ghost movement decisions
Personality-based behaviors for each ghost

5.2.2. Collision Detection
Grid-based collision checking for walls
Pixel-based collision detection for character interactions

5.2.3. Animation System
Sprite animation for character movement
Smooth transitions between game states

6. Coding Guidelines for AI LLM Development
6.1. Code Structure

```javascript

// Use modular pattern with clear separation of concerns
const Game = {
  // Public methods
  init() {},
  start() {},
  pause() {},
  
  // Private methods (prefix with _)
  _update() {},
  _render() {},
  
  // Sub-modules
  Board: {},
  Characters: {},
  UI: {}
};

```

6.2. Naming Conventions
Use camelCase for variables and functions: playerScore, updateGameState()
Use PascalCase for constructors: class GhostAI {}
Use UPPER_CASE for constants: GRID_SIZE, PELLET_VALUE
Prefix private members with underscore:_internalMethod()

6.3. Code Documentation

```javascript
/**

* Updates the game state based on the current frame
* @param {number} deltaTime - Time since last update in milliseconds
* @returns {void}
 */
function update(deltaTime) {
  // Implementation
}
```

6.4. Performance Considerations

Use requestAnimationFrame for game loop
Preload assets to avoid runtime loading delays
Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
Optimize collision detection using spatial partitioning

6.5. Mobile Optimization

Implement touch controls with larger hit areas
Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes
Optimize for mobile performance and battery life

6.6. AI Implementation Guidance

When using AI assistants for development:
Break tasks into small, specific prompts: Instead of "code the ghost AI", try "implement a pathfinding function for the red ghost that uses breadth-first search"
Request code with explanations:
Please provide JavaScript code for pellet collision detection with:

* Clear variable names
* Comments explaining the logic
* Error handling for edge cases

Ask for multiple implementations: "Show me two different approaches to animation timing and the pros/cons of each"
Validate AI-generated code:
Test thoroughly for edge cases
Check performance implications
Ensure consistency with existing codebase
Request optimization suggestions: "How can I optimize the rendering loop to maintain 60fps on mobile devices?"
