## Client/Server Architecture

This project now uses a true client-server model:
-   **`server.js`**: A Node.js application that acts as the authoritative game server. It manages the game state, processes all game logic (movement, collisions, AI), and synchronizes clients.
-   **`index.html`**: The frontend client that connects to the server. It is responsible for sending user input to the server and rendering the game state it receives. It does not contain any game logic.

This setup requires you to run the server application locally before you can play the game in your browser.

## Installation & How to Play

### Prerequisites
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) must be installed on your computer.

### Running the Game

1.  **Download Files**: Save `index.html`, `server.js`, and `package.json` into a new folder on your computer.

2.  **Open a Terminal**: Navigate your terminal or command prompt to the folder where you saved the files.

3.  **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the necessary WebSocket library for the server.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the Server**: Run this command to start the game server.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    You should see a message like `[SERVER] WebSocket server started on ws://localhost:8080`. Leave this terminal window running.

5.  **Play the Game**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The game will connect to your local server, and you can join the lobby and start playing. To play with a friend on the same computer, open `index.html` in a second browser tab or window.

## Controls

The game automatically detects your input method. Each browser window/tab can be controlled independently.

### Keyboard

-   **Player 1 (first to join):** Arrow Keys (‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí) to move, `Spacebar` for Phase Dash.
-   **Player 2 (second to join):** `WASD` to move, `Shift` for Phase Dash.
-   **General**: `P` to Pause, `R` to Reset (returns to lobby), `M` to Mute.

### Gamepad (Xbox/Standard Layout Recommended)

-   **D-Pad or Left Analog Stick**: Move
-   **(A) Button**: Execute Phase Dash
-   **(Start) Button**: Pause/Unpause Game
-   **(B) Button**: Reset Game (returns to lobby)

### Touch Controls (Mobile/Tablet)

-   **Virtual D-Pad**: Move
-   **DASH Button**: Execute Phase Dash

## Game Flow

1.  **Lobby**: Join as Player 1 or Player 2. The game can be started once at least one player has joined.
2.  **Gameplay**: Control your Pacclone, eat pellets, and compete for the highest score.
3.  **Game Over**: The game ends when only one player remains.
4.  **High Score**: If the top-scoring player achieves a high score, they will be prompted to enter their initials.
