# üëª Pacclone Multi

A classic arcade-style game reminiscent of Pac-Man, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a client-server architecture for multiplayer gameplay! Navigate the maze, eat all the pellets, avoid the ghosts, and compete to be the last one standing!

‚ú® Features

## Client/Server Architecture

This project uses a true client-server model:

- **`server.js`**: A Node.js application that acts as the authoritative game server engine. It manages the game state, processes all game logic (movement, collisions, AI), synchronizes clients, and serves the game client.
- **`index.html`**: The frontend client that connects to the server. It is responsible for sending user input to the server and rendering the game state it receives.

This setup requires you to run the server application before you can play the game in your browser.

## Installation & How to Play

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) must be installed on your computer or hosted with a node server and domain name.
- modern mobile, tv or desktop web browser.

### Running the Game

1. **Download Files**: Save `index.html`, `server.js`, and `package.json` into a new folder on your computer.
1a. **Optional**: git pull <https://github.com/Code24x7-R/pacclone-multi>


2. **Open a Terminal**: Navigate your terminal or command prompt to the folder where you saved the files.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the necessary WebSocket library for the server.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the Server**: Run this command to start the game server.

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

    You should see a message like `[SERVER] Listening on http://localhost:8080`. Leave this terminal window running.

5. **Play the Game**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. The game will load into the lobby. Enter your name and join. To play with friends, have them open the same URL in their browsers on the same network.

## Controls

The game automatically detects your input method. Each browser window/tab can be controlled independently.

### Keyboard

- **Movement**: Arrow Keys (‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí) or `WASD`

### Gamepad (Xbox/Standard Layout Recommended)

- **D-Pad or Left Analog Stick**: Move

### Touch Controls (Mobile/Tablet)

- **Virtual Joystick**: A joystick will appear on the screen for movement.

## Game Flow

1. **Lobby**: Join as Player 1, 2, 3, or 4. The game can be started by the host (Player 1) once at least one player has joined.
2. **Gameplay**: Control your Pacclone, eat pellets, eat power up pellets, chase and eat your opponents, and compete to be the last player with lives remaining or clear all pellets.
3. **Spectator Mode**: If you lose all your lives, you enter spectator mode.
